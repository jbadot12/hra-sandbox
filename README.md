# HRA Sandbox Environment

## Introduction
This repository contains the HTML and JavaScript needed to create a sandbox environment for testing our Health Risk Assessment (HRA) embed code. The main purpose is to ensure that UTM parameters are correctly passed from the landing page to our HRA application.

## Setup
To view and test the sandbox:
1. Visit [GitHub Pages URL] - replace [GitHub Pages URL] with the actual URL provided by GitHub Pages.
2. Append UTM parameters to the URL as query strings (e.g., `?utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=spring_sale`).

## Testing
Here's how to test different UTM parameters:
- Change the query string in the URL to reflect different sources, mediums, or campaigns.
- Observe if the parameters are captured correctly in the HRA embed code (visible through browser developer tools).
